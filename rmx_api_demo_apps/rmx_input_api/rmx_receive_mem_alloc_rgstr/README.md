# Rivermax Input API Memory Allocation and Registration Demo Application

## Description

This application demonstrates an example of explicit memory allocation and registration on the host side when using the Rivermax Input API. If memory allocation and registration are not performed explicitly, Rivermax handles these processes internally.
