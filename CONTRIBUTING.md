# Contribution Rules

Want to hack on the NVIDIA Rivermax Project ? Awesome!<br>
We only require you to sign your work, the below section describes this!<br>

## Sign Your Work
The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch. Your
signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass
it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
the below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):

We require that all contributors "Sign-Off" on their commits. This certifies
that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it
under the same license, or a compatible license.<br>
Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be
accepted.<br>
To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:<br>
```
$ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
```
This will append the following to your commit message:
```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
```
By doing this you certify the following:<br>
